class SnakeGame:
    """
    A simple structure for a Snake-like game.

    Attributes:
    -----------------
        window : Window
            The main window of the game.
            Makes sure that the implementation is visible to the user.

        snake_size : tuple(int, int)
            The size of the snake.

        snake : Snake
            The controllable snake.

        current_movement : Callable
            One of the four directional functions from the Snake class.
            Saved for convenience and used to call movement on the snake-attribute.

        fruit_coordinates : list(int, int)
            The positional coordinates of the fruit that the snake is to eat.

        fruit_size : tuple(int, int)
            The size of the fruit.

        running : bool
            Used to control the state of the game.
            If false, the player has either exited or lost the game.

        last_update_time : int
            If the difference between this and a clock check is above 150
            the method update_movement is called and this attribute
            updated.

    Methods:
    -----------------
        handle_keydown(event):
            Function to handle user input events incoming from the underlying pygame module.

        draw():
            Draw the game to the screen.

        move_fruit():
            Randomly moves the fruit until it does not collide with the snake anymore.
            Used after the fruit is picked up.

        fruit_pickup():
            Used to control if the snake is able to pick up the fruit.
            If the snake is able to pick the fruit up, the snake will grow
            and the fruit will be moved to a new position.

        check_if_inside_window():
            Used to control whether the snake is inside the boundaries of
            the screen or not. If the snake is not inside the boundaries,
            the game is over.

        run_game_logic():
            The main function used to run the game logic.
            Makes sure that all other functions are called as they should.

        game_loop():
            The entry point of the game.
            Clears the screen, runs the game logic, and make sure that the
            screen is presented at the end.

        update_move():
        Function to update the movement and control if the
        snake collides with itself.
